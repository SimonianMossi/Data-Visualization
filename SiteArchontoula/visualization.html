                    <p>The vizualization below tackles the issue of covid 19 as many have other studies since the year 2020.<br>
                    What I found particularly interesting is it's focus on the often overlooked casualties of this <br>
                    global pandemic that have survived the virus but have been pushed into poverty from the early 2019 to the end of 2020.<br>
                    I find that the design is simple enough so as to not overwhelm the eye but very clearly conveys the message it is supposed to.<br>
                    The three different poverty tiers are easily distinguishable with the use of different colors <br>
                    and the bottom panel presenting the statistics for each country is also easy to interpret. Overall I believe that <br>
                    it is important to draw focus on the aftermath of the continuous lockdowns in order for each state to take action <br>
                    for its people. With this in mind, if I were to make any changes in the visulization, I would like to also be able to <br>
                    view the absolute numbers accompanied by the percentages.</p>
